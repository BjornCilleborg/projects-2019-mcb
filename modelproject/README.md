# Modelproject

In this project we model an **intertemporal household optimization problem**, where we define a utility function in which a household or individual seeks to maximize his or her utility in a two-period scenario given an endowment of leisure. The model is based on discrete time. For reference one might look at Romer, D., "Advanced Macroeconomics", *McGraw Hill, 4th Edition* 2012.


Specifically, we model the trade-off between leisure and consumption and derive the optimal consumption smoothing path based on given parameter estimates of risk aversion, preference for leisure and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
